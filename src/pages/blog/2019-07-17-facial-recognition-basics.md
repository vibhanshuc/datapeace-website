Facial recognition has come a long way from the mid-90s till now.

Facial Recognition technology has attracted the tech market for its versatile utility since quite some time now. From smart phones using it as our passwords to the government adapting this technology to protect criminal and other records, facial recognition has carved a niche for itself.

Facial recognition targets human emotions like happiness, sadness, surprise,  anger, etc or we can simply say it works on the algorithm of a human face.

The facial recognition market is expected to grow to $7.7 billion in 2022 from $4 billion in 2017 (source). Thatâ€™s because facial recognition technology is very unique and apt. It can be used for everything from security to e-commerce. 

There are various technologies by which facial recognition works but if to be put in layman language there are generally 4-steps to this process.

Step1: Photo of your face is captured

Step2: Software reads your face

Step3: Software matches your face in its database.

Step4: Face match accepted/rejected

Facial recognition can be used in diverse areas. Some of them are Airports, mobile phones, Social Media, Building entries and exits, etc.

Keeping in mind both technology and facial recognition, experts have come up with this amazing software known as Visitor Management System. 

Visitor Management System is an online system to maintain or track the movement of humans in or out of any premises. It amplifies the security quotient by preserving details and records of visitors, electronically. 

Facial Recognition, being a remarkable software technology is for sure embarking its way to becoming the next big thing for our amplified security and safety!
