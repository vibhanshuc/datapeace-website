title: 'Why cloud should precede fog? '

  CTOs and CXOs in general get excited about the possibility of doing fog while
  rolling out their cloud journeys. In the India context this excitement is
  understandable as well. The country is big. Markets and operations are
  distributed. There are immense overheads in securing, servicing and
  maintaining software and hardware infrastructure at the nodes. In fact, most
  business leaders claim that a large part of their technology budgetary
  allocation today goes to maintaining the as-is in their regional hubs and
  further downstream nodes. Hence, the desire to quickly make everything
  ‘cloudy’ or rather ‘foggy’ as is the more common parlance.

We at Data Peace empathize with this requirement of the business and often give a thumbs up to businesses that are in control of their infrastructure such as technology companies ad telecommunication companies. However, we discourage our other clients to make the jump on the two bandwagons simultaneously. This is because we feel that when the cloud moves down (it becomes a fog) closer to the end user systems it can only be successful in delivering key business outcomes if the following is taken care of:

## Incomplete Cloud Journey

 Most large businesses have legacy systems and their cloud journeys are more than often a mish-mash between the two – legacy and the new cloud ecosystems. Often, systems such as CRM and ERP, which are required to be fogged first, are straddling both these ecosystems, hence cumbersome to be fogged. We often emphasise to our clients that they need to complete their cloud journeys before they consider fogging. The systems need stabilise on the cloud and become a cloud only environment before fogging can be recommended. 

## Security Compromises

 The security strength of the fog is premised on its conceptualisation, architecture and final implementation. Understand, that fogging is customisation. It is not standardised for each application in an enterprise. Hence, security needs to be often re-architected so that the security promises of the cloud continue to hold for the business and its customers. 

## Availability and Latency

 The fog is an extension of the cloud. However, the fog is a distributed environment at its heart. On account of this distribution, we discourage clients to latch on to a fog unless they can guarantee availability and latency requirements for applications. In a country where technology and network infrastructure is not homogeneous, it is best to understand the ramifications of fogging for system availability and latency. 

So next time you are tempted to think of establishing a fog, keep these points in mind, and yes, do remember to talk to us!
